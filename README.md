# Mello

Mello is a Trello-inspired interactive project planning application, built with React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Redux, with Material UI for styling. Mello allows users to organize tasks into boards, lists, and cards with a clean and intuitive interface. Mello is designed with functionality in mind to enhance productivity and showcase my own full stack development skills.
